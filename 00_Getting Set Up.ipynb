    "## Getting Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, I recommend using Python3. Depending on your configuration, you may already have Python3 installed, but you likely don't have all of the Scientific and Geospatial packages installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python3 with Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Python3, or all of the packages, I would recommend installing them via Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the documentation:\n",
    "> AnacondaÂ® is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python distribution, and a collection of over 1,000+ open source packages. It is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Anaconda Distribution 5 is a free, easy-to-install package manager, environment manager and Python distribution with a collection of 1,000+ open source packages with free community support. Anaconda is platform-agnostic, so you can use it whether you are on Windows, macOS or Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Anaconda install instructions are here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\n",
    "  * [Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)\n",

    "If prompted to select a Python version, use the Python 3.x version.\n",

    "### Installing additional packages with Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many packages that make working with Geospatial data easier in Python, here is a selection from [SpatialPython](https://github.com/SpatialPython/spatial_python/blob/master/packages.md): \n",
